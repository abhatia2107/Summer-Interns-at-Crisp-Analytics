MVC-(MODEL VIEW CONTROLLER)
===========================

example:put data in db
connection->query->resultset->business logic
<?php if $_ROW("marks")>70>
<td>Disticntion

->knowledge  required
->replica of td
->preknowledge of db  field required
->we concern with distinction(business view) not marks(database view)
->so require controller for conversion


3 parts :

-connection part(MODEL)
	->INTERACT WITH DB
 	->HANDLE BUSINESS LOGIC


-conversion part(CONTROLLER)
	->HANDLE USER REQUESTS
	->CONVERSION TO DOMAIN LOGIC
	->WINDOW TOWARDS THE  SYSTEM
	->WHICH URL SHOULD OPEN WHAT THAT IS WHAT ARE ENDPOINTS
	->WHICH URL WIL CALL WHAT CONTROLLER

-VIEW that in template (VIEW)
	->DESIGNING ETC

LATER FAT  MODELS THIN CONTROLLER
