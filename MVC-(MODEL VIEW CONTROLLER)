MVC-(MODEL VIEW CONTROLLER)
===========================

example:put data in db
connection->query->resultset->business logic
<?php if $_ROW("marks")>70>
<td>Disticntion

->knowledge  required
->replica of td
->preknowledge of db  field required
->we concern with distinction(business view) not marks(database view)
->so require controller for conversion


3 parts :

-connection part(MODEL)
	->INTERACT WITH DB
 	->HANDLE BUSINESS LOGIC


-conversion part(CONTROLLER)
	->HANDLE USER REQUESTS
	->CONVERSION TO DOMAIN LOGIC
	->WINDOW TOWARDS THE  SYSTEM
	->WHICH URL SHOULD OPEN WHAT THAT IS WHAT ARE ENDPOINTS
	->WHICH URL WIL CALL WHAT CONTROLLER

-VIEW that in template (VIEW)
	->DESIGNING ETC

LATER FAT  MODELS THIN CONTROLLER
      ========================== 


USER->CONTROLLER-|<->MODAL
				 |->VIEW

EARLER NO INTERACTION B/W MODEL AND VIEW.
WHEN RUBY ON RAILS COME ON THEN THESE 2 INTERACT ONLY IN CASE OF VALIDATIONS.


WHY MODEL INTERACT WITH VIEW?
example teacher choose best student

IF SAY WE HAVE DROPDOWN OF ALL STUDENTS THEN NO PROBLEM
BUT IF WE HAVE TEXTBOX TO ENTER THEN THIS VALIDATION IS DONE BY THIS ONLY.

IN AJAX CALL USER INVOKE SOME OTHER CONTROLLER OF OTHER MVC
THEN IT WILL CREATE ITS OWN VIEW
->REST APIs USED


C->M->C->V

C->M->C->V->C->USER

ROUTE IS USED FOR COMMUNICATING COTROLLR AND MODEL


->ALL THREE SHOULD BE DECOUPLED MEANS LEAST DEPENDENCY
